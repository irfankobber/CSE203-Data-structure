/*

-------------------function overloading------------------

it's a feature of c++ where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters

function overloading can be considered as an example of polymorphism feature in c++

---------------------------function overriding------------------------------------

If derived class defines the same function as its base class then it is known as function overriding 

if u create an object of the drived class and call the member function which exists in both classes
(base and derived), the member function of the dreived class in invoked and the function of the ase class is ignored

it enables you to provide specific implementation of the function which is laready provided by its base class
