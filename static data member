-----------------------------------Static Data Members in C++-----------------------------------
A static member is shared by all objects of the class.

all static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created if no other intialization is present.

We can't put it in the class defination but it can be initialized outise the class using the scope resolution operator :: to indetify which class it belongs to 

When we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of the class are created there is only one copy of the static member
