-----------------------------------Inheritance------------------------------------
Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class
Provides Reusability and maintainibility of code

The class from which the new class inherits properties(data members and member functions)
is  called the base class.

the newly created class is called the derived class.

there are 5 types of inheritance ;
