Polymorphism in c++
poly means multiple and morphism means forms so multiple forms

in simple words polymorphism means that the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 

In c++, an operator or function can be given different meanings

polymophism can be divided into two different parts

1. compile time polymorphism- includes function overloading, operator overloading and templates.
2. runtime polymorphism - includes function overriding
