//using pointer to structures allows us to create a single pointer variable of struct type in the main function. We can then use it to access various different stuctures
//basically using one ptr we can access age,name,salary of many stucture variables like person1,person2, person3 etc

#include <fstream> //used for file handling
using namespace std;

//create a variable of struct type
// create a pointer and point to it.
// use the pointer to take input and display output
